* **Authentication Architecture:** Built a Django REST backend with **JWT authentication** and refresh flows for enhanced security.
* **Custom User Logic:** Implemented a custom user model using email as the primary identifier combined with **Ethiopian phone validation**.
* **Clean API Design:** Exposed modular `/api/auth` endpoints for registration, login, and token refreshing to support frontend integration.

### Project Impact
* **Social Goal:** Designed to reunite individuals separated due to conflict or displacement.
* **Recognition:** Earned positive recognition from **GDG mentors** for technical execution and community relevance.
