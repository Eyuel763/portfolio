### Overview
I built a RESTful Social Media API with **Django REST Framework** that supports user authentication, posts, comments, likes, follows, and notifications. It is designed as a clean, token-authenticated backend for a lightweight social platform.

### Technical Highlights
* **Secure Authentication:** Implemented user registration, login, and profile management using **DRF Token Authentication**.
* **Core Social Logic:** Engineered complex relationships for following/unfollowing users and generating a **personalized feed**.
* **Scalable Endpoints:** Developed endpoints for posts, comments, and likes with built-in **pagination defaults** for performance.
* **Notification System:** Integrated notification triggers for social interactions to improve user engagement.

### Feature Highlights
* User registration and profile management.
* Post creation, editing, comments, and likes/unlikes.
* Follow/unfollow relationships and personalized content delivery.
* Media-serving configurations optimized for development environments.
